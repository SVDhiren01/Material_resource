# Material_resource
This is a web application where the faculty can upload study materials, assignments, etc and students can view the materials depending on the course chosen.
Here the backend hasn't been implemented.
But a few web pages have been hosted on the localhost using NodeJs/ExpressJs.

There is a landing page which gives us options to select either login/signup/demo.
Based on the option chosen, page gets redirected to the desired page.

If time persisted, this webpage was going to be hosted on Heroku.


I learnt NodeJs in this 2 days and tried to use it as much as possible.
